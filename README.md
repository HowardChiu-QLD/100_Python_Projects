# 100_Python_Projects
This projects are based on Dr. Angela Yu's course-100 days of code.
By finishing each challenge assigned for a day, the purpose is to sharpen the Python coding skill set.
Additionally, without memorising the syntx and specific function in Python, I believe in memorising them efficiently in real example.
Every project contained an explanation and purpose in the beginning of the code and the rest part of functioning code along with comments.
